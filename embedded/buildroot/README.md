## Configure for docker

To use ReswarmOS as a docker host we need three components:

1. docker-cli
1. docker-engine
1. containerd

```
make menuconfig
```

1. Toolchain -> glibc (most important!!)
1. Target Packages -> System Tools -> docker-cli
1. Target Packages -> System Tools -> docker-compose
1. Target Package -> System Tools -> <all further docker compontents>...

## How to find a particular package

To check for a particular package, do

```
ls package | grep <somepackage>
```

The corresponding subdirectory contains all information and i.a.
dependencies of the package. To find the location of a particular
package in the menu of _menuconfig_ we have to have a look at 
`package/Config.in` where any developer adding a package has to 
specify where the package is supposed to appear in the menu.
For instance:

```
cat package/Config.in | grep time -A 20
```

## Resize RootFS

To resize the root filesystem we have to 

1. increase the root partition
2. adjust the ext4 filesystem to occupy all space in the partition

To this end we need the tools `parted` and `resize2fs` that are included in the packages
`parted` and `e2fsprogs`, which can be found in the _buildroot_ repository.

## Obsolete

Add remaining packages by hand by appending to _.config_ (check
list of packages [Buildroot packages](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/tree/master/package)
